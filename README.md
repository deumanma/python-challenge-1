## Food Truck Menu Ordering System

For this Challenge I created a menu ordering system, that gives users 4 menu different menus to choose from and under each subsequent menu the food options available to them. They could order as many times as they want for each different menu, and at the end it totals all of the items ordered and prints out a receipt. 

### Resources Used

For this assignment I used the source code that was provided for menu.py to work off of. I also used solution code that was provided by our instructor in week 2 called print_a_solution_menu.py this had a lot of similar code from the starter code that was already provided, but I used it as a reference and to validate my the code I was writing. 

I used stack overflow to ask questions and get the code for a new line that I used to space out the customer inputs to make the interface less busy. Pythontutor.com was a helpful resource that I used to run my code through when I didn't understand what was going on or supposed to happen when looking at solutions provided by the instructor to help me move forward. 

I also got a few lines of code from chatgpt that I commented starting on lines 93. I used chat GPT similarily to google to ask it to explain concepts I was struggling with and looking at terminal error messages. 

I asked the BSC slack app for a clarifying question when I was struggling with the customer input, they were able to clarify the goal of the exercise but no code was provided. 

I did have a lot of problems and eventually got so confused on the code I had written that I started over with a clean starter code file because I couldn't tell what was my commented out code that didn't work and what was part of the assignment file. I definitely see the importance of creating good comments for code you may be saving for later or coming back to.
